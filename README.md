# Machine Learning Linear Regression

## Description:

This project involves building a predictive model using the Linear Regression algorithm.
You will work in pairs to submit the code and a detailed report of your work.
The goal is to predict a person's weight based on their height using the provided dataset.

## DataSet:

Link: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/lhau97ll9bwvewqa0rm2q/Height_Weight.csv?rlkey=b92qo151troherwy7t9h3gnil&e=1&dl=0

- The dataset includes instances of height (in inches) and weight (in pounds).



## Tasks

### Data Preprocessing:

- Convert heights from inches to centimeters.

- Convert weights from pounds to kilograms.

- Print main statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, min, and max) of the features in a table.


### Model Construction:

- Split the data into 70% training and 30% test sets.

- Generate models using subsets of the dataset and evaluate their performance:

   M1: 100 random instances

   M2: 1,000 random instances

   M3: 5,000 random instances

   M4: Entire dataset


### Model Evaluation:

- Use appropriate regression metrics to test the performance of each model.

- Compare and analyze the performance of the models.
